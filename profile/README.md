The Learning and Vision Lab(LV-Lab) at the National University of Singapore is a team of researchers dedicated to pushing the boundaries of computer vision, machine learning, and their real-life applications. Founded in 2007 by Associate Professor Shuicheng Yan and led by Assistant Professor Jiashi Feng from 2015, the group is currently led by Assistant Professor Xinchao Wang. The group's research interests range from fundamental machine learning methods to cutting-edge face/human and image/video analytics techniques, to intelligent search and recommendation systems. The team has achieved significant success, with over 600 technical papers published in top international academic journals and conferences and several best paper or best student paper prizes.

LV's research interests include neural architecture, deep learning, graph neural networks, knowledge transfer, 3D modeling, explainable AI, multi-modal, image editing, and generation. The team comprises over 20 PhD students, Research Fellows, and Research Assistants, as well as visiting professors and students, with over 100 alumni who continue to contribute to the community and society. The group's mission is to target unexplored or unsolved problems to advance computer vision and machine learning technologies and ultimately improve people's lives.
